Gauss Crack is released under either the GPLv2 license or the BSD (3-point) license.

The goal of the program is to find the target of the Gauss Virus so that the encrypted payload can finally be decrypted.

The algorithm step taken by this application is outlined in https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193781/The_Mystery_of_the_Encrypted_Gauss_Payload#comments

Quick explination of the code:
    MainWindow
        - All user input / output

    KeyPairQueue
        - Gets all the environment paths and applicaiton names outlined in validation step 1 and creates a queue of the key pairs

    HashThread
        - Pulls a keypair from the queue, appends salt, does the actual hashing and comparing

    HashGenerator
        - Contains and manages multiple HashThreads. Intermediate between HashThread and MainWindow
